ingredients:
- 1 12 oz bag potato chips, salt and vinegar
- 1 egg
- 2 tsp water
- 1 rib pork chop, 1 to 1.5 inch thick, bone on
- seasoned flour
- oil

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F.
- Put the chips in a zip top bag, seal and roughly crush them. Donâ€™t go for a uniform meal, just beat them up: you want a contrast of size and shape.
- Transfer the chips to a pie pan. Beat the egg together with 2 tsp of water and place the mixture in a second pie pan.
- Place the chop in a third pie pan and dredge with seasoned flour. Shake off any excess flour and coat the chop in the egg mixture.
- Drain briefly, then transfer the chop to the potato chip pan. Press on the pieces so that the chop is completely coated. Place on a rack and let the chop rest for 20 to 30 minutes.
- In the meantime, in a cast iron skillet or an electric skillet, heat enough shortening to come halfway up the side of the chop to 350 degrees F.
- Cook the chop for 1 minute on each side or until golden brown. Transfer to the a rack set over a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake for 27 to 30 minutes or until the internal temperature hits 145 degrees F.
