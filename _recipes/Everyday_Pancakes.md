ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar, optional
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/2 to 2 cups milk
- 2 tablespoons melted and cooled butter (optional), plus unmelted butter for cooking, or use neutral oil

directions:
- Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl, mix together dry ingredients. Beat eggs into 1 1/2 cups milk, then stir in 2 tablespoons melted cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten flour; don't worry about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk.
- Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When butter foam subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes of any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary; usually, first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes.
- Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on an ovenproof plate in a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.

An important thing to remember about the cooking part is this - you have to preheat the skillet or griddle, or the first batch will be nearly worthless. To determine when the pan is hot enough to take the batter, heat it over medium heat until a few drops of water skid across the surface before evaporating. A well-seasoned cast iron pan will need little or no butter or oil, but if you choose stainless steel or aluminum pans, use plenty of butter; the net result will be that the pancakes will taste better.

The most time-consuming part of making pancakes from scratch isn’t making the batter; it’s cooking them. But that time is so short you should consider pancakes an everyday convenience food, and one that you can easily modify.
