ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons bacon grease
- 2 pinches kosher salt
- 1 sprig rosemary (bruised (this is, crushed roughly between your hands)*)
- 8 ears fresh corn (about 3 pounds total) or 3 can vacuum packed corn
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric (to up the yellow a bit)
- 2 tablespoons stone-ground cornmeal
- 1 cup heavy cream (it is called "creamed corn" ya know)
- 1 pinch black pepper (freshly ground)

directions:
- Place a paper bowl upside down in the middle of a large mixing bowl.
- If you have an old-fashioned corn on the cob holder, insert one in the skinny end and place the ear vertically on the small bowl and using a chefâ€™s knife, cut off the kernels.
- When all the kernels have been removed, turn the knife around and use the spine of the blade to carefully scrape out any remaining pulp.
- Heat bacon grease in skillet until just barely smoking.
- Add the corn to the skillet and continue cooking over medium-high heat until the liquid from the corn thickens a bit, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle the cornmeal, sugar, and turmeric onto the corn mixture and stir to combine. Add the cream, reduce the heat to medium and cook until the corn is very soft, 2 to 3 minutes.
- Fish out the rosemary, season with pepper and serve as a side to just about anything.
