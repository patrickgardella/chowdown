yield: 8 Servings

ingredients:
- 6 egg yolks
- 120 gms – 1/2 cup + 1 1/2 tbsp sugar
- 40 gms – 1/3 cup corn starch
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder
- 170 gms - 6 oz. dark chocolate, melted
- 1 lt. – 4 cups milk, hot

directions:
- In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, cinnamon powder, and corn starch until white and fluffy.
- Add the melted chocolate and keep whisking.
- Add the milk, while whisking constantly.
- Put the mixture on the fire and slowly and cook on a medium flame until it boils and the cream thickens.  It will be quite frothy at the beginning, but the foam will disappear once it starts to boil (at this point, the crema catalana will be ready).
- Divide the cream between 8 ramekins and let it cool down. When at room temperature, put it in the fridge until you are ready to serve it.
- Just before serving, sprinkle ½ tablespoon of sugar on each chocolate crema catalana and brûlée it using a torch.
- Serve immediately.
