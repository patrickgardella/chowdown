ingredients:
- 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 cup milk warm
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup margarine or softened unsalted butter
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 eggs
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup brown sugar packed
- 3 tbsp cinnamon
- 1/3 cup margarine softened
- 6 tbsp butter
- 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar - 6oz
- 1/4 cup cream cheese - 2oz
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/8 tsp salt

directions:
- For the rolls, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl. Let it sit for about 5 minutes. If the yeast is good, it will start to froth up.
- Add sugar, butter, salt, eggs, and flour to the bowl of a mixer and mix well.
- Pour the milk/yeast mixture in the bowl and using the dough hook, mix well until well incorporated.
- Place dough into an oiled bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
- Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface, until it is approx 16 inches long by 12 inches wide. It should be approx 1/4 inch thick.
- Preheat oven to 350 F degrees. Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
- To make filling, combine the butter or margarine, brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.
- Spread the mixture evenly over the surface of the dough. Alternatively you can spread the butter first on the dough and then the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.
- Working carefully, from the long edge, roll the dough down to the bottom edge. The roll should be about 18 inches in length. Cut the roll into 1 1/2 inch slices. You might find it easier if you use a piece of floss vs a knife.
- Place the cut rolls in the prepared pan. Cover them with a damp towel. Let them rise again for another 30 minutes until they double in size.
- Bake for 20 minutes or until light golden brown. Cooking time can vary greatly!
- While the rolls are baking make the icing by mixing all ingredients and beat well with an electric mixer until fluffy.
- When the rolls are done, spread generously with icing.

Recipe Notes

Prep time does not include time to let the dough rise.

Make sure your milk is not too hot or it could kill the yeast which will cause your dough not to rise at all. The ideal temperature for the milk should be between 105 F degrees and 110 F for proofing. While 95 F degrees is the best temperature for yeast to multiply, that's not warm enough for proofing active dry yeast.

If after dissolving the yeast in the warm milk, the yeast didn't start to froth up, do not continue with the rolls, your dough will not rise.

You could also use instant or rapid-rise yeast instead of the active dry yeast. If you do, you do not need to dissolve the yeast in the warm milk. It could be mixed right into the dough.

TIP: To speed up the dough rising process, heat your oven to 200 F degrees. Turn off the oven and place your dough as specified in step 4 in the oven with the door closed. This will ensure a warm environment for your dough and the dough will rise fairly quickly, assuming the yeast was good.

You could prepare this the day before up until step 10. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge overnight. The rolls should continue to rise in the fridge but if by morning they have not doubled in size, turn your oven on to 200 F degrees until it warms up, then turn it off. Place the pan in the oven for about 30 to 45 minutes until the rolls double in size. Then you can bake them as instructed.

To freeze unbaked rolls, complete everything up to and including step 10, then wrap the pan in two layers of plastic wrap. Freeze for 8 hours up to 6 weeks. The night before you want to bake the rolls, thaw them out in the refrigerator, still wrapped. They will thaw overnight. Finish the rest of the steps to bake them.
