yield: 6 pita
date: June 28 2019

ingredients:
- 1/2 lb ground lamb (turkey, chicken, or lean ground beef are acceptable substitutions)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (clarified butter or ghee would be ideal, but don’t go crazy)
- ¼ cup minced shallot
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 jalapeno, serrano or other small hot chili pepper
- ½ tablespoon cumin
- ½ tablespoon coriander
- ¼ teaspoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon garlic, crushed
- Kosher salt
- Ground black pepper

directions:
- Using the same naan recipe as before, divide the dough into 6 larger pieces instead of 12. During the second rise, add the oil to a 10” skillet over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the onion and pepper, sauteing until the onion is translucent. Add the garlic, tomato paste and spices, cooking until fragrant—about 30 seconds.
- Crumble the lamb (or ground meat of your choosing) into the pan, and season with salt and pepper. As the lamb cooks, break it down into the smallest pieces you possibly can. This will ensure a more even and “flatbread” in the finished product. I’ve had good results with quickly pulsing finished and cooled ground meats in a food processor, and this was no exception. Whatever route you choose, once the filling has finished cooking, remove it to a bowl to cool.
- On a well floured surface, gently roll the larger naan balls out into small circles (or shapes that vaguely resemble them). Scoop a heaping tablespoon of the now cooled filling into the center of each piece, and pinch edges of the dough shut, as shown below.
- Flip the now filled dough ball over, and use your hands to form it back into a now filled ball. Using a rolling pin and the gentlest touch possible, roll the dough into a familiar flatbread shape. Don’t be aggressive or go too thin here, we want to keep the filling inside after all.
- As before, grill your now filled naan over high heat for 1-2 minutes per side, brush with butter, and serve immediately. Like the dough, these can be frozen as well—after you flatten the stuffed ball, a piece of parchment paper on a half baking sheet will help to prevent sticking. To bring them back, simply thaw in the refrigerator before grilling. Now that you’re armed with the knowledge of grillable stuffed breads, there’s unlimited potential for sweet and savory combinations.

Keema is a fairly common filling, and basically everything I was looking for. At first glance, I thought “Oh goodness, this is basically Shepherd’s Pie filling with hugely boosted flavor.” And it did not disappoint.
