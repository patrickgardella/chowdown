ingredients:
- 4 large eggs 
- 1 cup granulated sugar 
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil 
- 1/2 cup honey 
- 2 cups all-purpose flour 
- 2 teaspoons baking powder 
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
- 2 cups diced fresh mango (from 1 mango) 
- 1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans 
- 1/2 cup golden raisins 
- 1 tablespoon orange zest (from 1 orange) 
- 2 teaspoons lime zest (from 2 limes)
- 1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar 
- 1 teaspoon orange zest plus 
- 1⁄4 cup fresh juice (from 1 orange) 
- 1/2 teaspoon lime zest plus 
- 2 tsp. fresh juice (from 1 lime)

directions:
- Prepare the Cake: Preheat oven to 325°F. Lightly oil and flour a 14-cup Bundt pan. Beat eggs in bowl of a stand mixer on medium speed until fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Beat in sugar until combined; then beat in oil until combined. Gradually beat in honey.
- Whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture, ½ cup at a time, to egg mixture, beating just until blended after each addition. Stir in mango, nuts, raisins, orange zest, and lime zest. Pour batter into prepared pan.
- Bake in preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Remove to a wire rack, and let stand in pan 10 minutes. 
- Prepare the Topping: While the Cake stands in pan, stir together powdered sugar, orange and lime zest, and orange and lime juice until combined. Invert Cake onto a plate. Drizzle Topping evenly over warm inverted Cake. (Or make a glaze, stirring together about 1 cup sifted powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon fresh orange juice; pour over cooled Cake.)
