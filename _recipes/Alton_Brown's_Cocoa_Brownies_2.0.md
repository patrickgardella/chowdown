ingredients:

- 4 large eggs
- 7 ounces granulated sugar
- 6 ounces light brown sugar
- 5 3/4 ounces natural cocoa powder (not Dutch process)
- 2 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 8 ounces unsalted butter, melted
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

directions:
- Crank the oven to 300 degrees F.
- Lube an 8-inch square baking pan with non-stick spray. Trim a piece of parchment paper so that it fits just inside the baking dish with overhang on two sides and place it inside the pan.
- Beat the eggs with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until fluffy and light yellow, 2 to 3 minutes.
- In a separate bowl, combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, cocoa powder, flour and salt. Drop the mixer speed to low and slowly introduce the sugar mixture. Follow with the butter and vanilla. Continue mixing until you've got a nice, smooth goo.
- Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
- Bake the brownies for 15 minutes, then remove them from the oven for 15 minutes.
- Put them back in the oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the brownie, reads 195 degrees F (about 30 minutes).
- Cool in the pan for 3 minutes, then lift the brownie out using the parchment paper as a sling.
- Cut the brownies into 9 pieces until a pizza wheel and move to a rack to cool completely.

Proof positive that technique is just as important as ingredients. This is version 2.0 a change up in the baking time creates an ooey-gooey brownie, different than the original recipe.
