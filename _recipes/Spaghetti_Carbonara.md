ingredients:
- 2 large eggs and 2 large yolks, at room temperature
- 1/3 cup grated Pecorino Romano, plus more as needed (1 oz)
- 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese (1 oz)
- Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 ½ ounces pancetta, sliced into 1/3 inch square cubes (try guanciale or bacon)
- 12 ounces spaghetti

directions:
- Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Don't add the spaghetti yet. (Optional- Fill a large bowl with hot water for serving, and set aside.)
- In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks, Pecorino Romano and Parmesan. Season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper.
- Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the pancetta, and sauté until the fat just renders, and it's crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.
- Cook the spaghetti until al dente. Just before pasta is ready, reheat pancetta in skillet. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and add to the skillet over low heat. Stir for a minute or so.
- (Optional- Empty serving bowl of hot water. Dry it and add hot pasta mixture. )  Stir in cheese mixture, adding some reserved pasta water if needed for creaminess. Serve immediately, garnishing with a bit of additional grated pecorino and pepper.
