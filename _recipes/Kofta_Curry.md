ingredients:
- 1 green chilli
- ¾ tbsp garlic paste
- ¾ tbsp ginger paste
- 400 gms – 1 ½ cups tomato puree
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp turmeric
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper
- ½ tbsp garam masala
- 1 ½ tbsp coriander powder
- 1 ½ tbsp kasuri methi
- 75 gms – ¾ cup cashew nuts, turned into a paste
- 240 ml – 1 cup heavy cream
- 100 ml water
- 1 ½ tbsp vegetable oil
- Salt to taste

directions:
- Mix together all the ingredients for the koftas.
- Make small balls (the size of a small lime) with the mixture. Put them on a baking sheet, cover with cling wrap and put them in the fridge to set for 1 hour.
- Now you can either deep fry them or boil them directly with the sauce until they are cooked through. I tried both methods and though the first one is the traditional way to make koftas, I actually like the “straight into the sauce” method more as the koftas come out softer and you save some time and calories too.
- Blend the onion into a paste.
- Heat the vegetable oil in a thick bottom pan and fry off your blended onion, ginger paste and garlic paste. Cook them until all the liquid in the paste evaporates. Make sure you cook this through and do so on a medium heat, stirring frequently so as not to burn it.
- Once the paste becomes golden brown add the cumin powder, salt, turmeric, cayenne pepper and coriander powder. Stir and quickly add the tomato puree.
- Cook the sauce until it begins to thicken.
- In the meantime, blend your cashewnuts until they become a paste and add this and the cream to the sauce.
- Cook the sauce for 5 minutes, then add the garam masala and kasuri methi.
- Mix, add the water and all the koftas.
- Turn the heat to low, cover the pan with a lid and let it cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until the koftas are cooked through.
