ingredients:
- 1 (4-5 lb) whole broiler chicken
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 chicken bullion cubes
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp ground pepper
- 2/3 cup cake flour (3 oz)
- 1 1/3 cup AP flour (6.65 oz)
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 3 Tbsp shortening
- 1 Tbsp bacon drippings
- 2/3 cup milk

directions:
- Bring chicken (including neck and giblets), water to cover, garlic powder, thyme, 1 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper to a boil in a dutch oven over medium heat. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 1 hour. Remove chicken. Reserve broth.
- Cool chicken 30 minutes; skin, bone and shred chicken. Skim fat from broth.
- While cooling the chicken, make dumplings. Combine flours and baking powder in bowl. Cut in shortening and bacon drippings with a pastry blender until crumbly. Stir in milk. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/8” thickness and cut into 1” square pieces.
- Return chicken to broth, and add bouillon cubes, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp ground pepper. Cook for 10 minutes, raising heat to nearly boiling (but still a simmer).
- Drop dumplings, a few at a time, into simmering broth, stirring gently. Cover and simmer, stirring often, 25 minutes.
