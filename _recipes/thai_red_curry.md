ingredients:

- 8 ounces rice noodles
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small white onion, peeled and thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 8 cups vegetable stock
- 1 (15-ounce) can coconut milk
- 3-6 tablespoons Thai red curry paste, added to taste
- 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, sliced into thick rounds
- 2 cups cooked chopped protein (such as shrimp, chicken, steak, pork or tofu)
- 2-3 cups chopped vegetables (see ideas below)
- toppings: chopped fresh cilantro, chopped green or red onion, toasted sesame seeds

directions:

- Cook the rice noodles (or rice or grains).  In a large stockpot, cook the noodles (or rice or grains) according to the package instructions.  Drain in a colander, then rinse briefly with cold water, drizzle with a splash of oil (I like to use toasted sesame oil), then toss until the noodles are evenly coated to help prevent them from sticking.  Set aside.
- Cook the broth.  Meanwhile, heat oil in a separate large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add garlic and sauté for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally.  Add in the veggie stock, coconut milk, curry paste and ginger, and stir to combine.  Continue cooking until the broth reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until ready to serve.  Taste and season with salt, black pepper, and/or extra curry paste, as needed.  Meanwhile…
- Cook your proteins (if using).  As I mentioned above, you can either cook your protein by simmering it in the broth.  Or you can cook it separately (in the oven, on the stove, or in the Instant Pot, depending on your protein) and then add it in at the end.
- Cook your veggies.  You also have the choice of cooking your veggies by simmering them in the broth until tender.  Or you can cook them separately and add them in at the end.
- Combine everything together.  Once the elements above are all ready to go, you can either combine and stir them all together in your big stockpot.  Or, you can layer the elements together one by one in your individual serving bowls.  Sprinkle each serving bowl with your desired toppings, serve warm and enjoy.

THAI CURRY VARIATIONS:
This recipe is super-flexible and easy to customize however you would like!  For example, feel free to:

Add meat or seafood: As I mentioned above, chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp would all be delicious mixed into in this curry!
Make it spicier: Feel free to add in some sliced Thai bird chiles or crushed red pepper flakes to amp up the heat.
Make it milder: Accidentally add too much red curry paste?  Just add in more coconut milk or water to thin the broth out a bit.  (Also keep in mind if you sample the broth that the other ingredients in there will help to mellow it out a bit with each bite.)
Make it brothier: Feel free to double the amount of broth ingredients (oil, onion, garlic, stock, coconut milk, curry paste, ginger) if you would like an even soupier curry.
Make it less brothy: Or on the flip side, feel free to halve the broth ingredients (oil, onion, garlic, stock, coconut milk, curry paste, ginger) if you would like a less soupier curry.
Use a different color of curry paste: This recipe works with either Thai red curry paste, yellow curry paste, or green curry paste — up to you.
MEAL PREP TIPS:
If you are making this recipe to store in meal prep containers for the week ahead, note that the noodles tend to soak up the broth the longer they sit.  Which is, of course, delicious.  And storing them together is definitely the easier option.

But — if you are like me and prefer a soupier curry, I recommend cooking and storing the noodles and broth separately.  Then you can rewarm them each and ladle the broth (along with its veggies and proteins) on top of the noodles just before serving.

This curry will store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or can be frozen for up to 3 months.
