ingredients:
- 14 large egg whites, at room temperature
- 700 (24.7oz) caster sugar (granulated sugar pulsed 15 times in food processor) 3.5 cups
- 2 tsp cream tartar
- 900ml double cream (Heavy cream - 42%) - 30.4 fl oz
- 6 tbsp raspberry conserve (jam?)
- 250g raspberries - 8.8 oz
- 500g mascarpone - 17.6 oz
- 3 tbsp lemon curd
- 2 lemons
- 750g raspberries - 26.5 oz
- 500g strawberries, hulled - 17.6 oz
- 150g redcurrants - Blueberries? - 5.3 oz
- 2 tbsp caster sugar
- 100g white chocolate - 3.5 oz
- melted yellow rose petals and sugared almonds (optional)

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 300ºC
- Start by making the base meringue. Tip the egg whites into the spotlessly clean, dry bowl of a free-standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.
- Whisk the egg whites until they will hold a stiff peak.
- Gradually add the sugar, whisking constantly until it has all been incorporated and the meringue is thick and glossy. Add the cream of tartar and give a final quick whisk to thoroughly combine.
- Spoon the meringue out onto the middle of the lined baking tray and spread into a round, approximately 30cm in diameter and using a palette knife to create elegant swirls on the side of the pavlova. Slide the baking tray onto the middle shelf of the preheated oven, immediately turn the temperature down to 200ºF and bake for 3 and ½ hours until the meringue is pale and crisp. Turn off the oven and leave the meringue inside to cool completely.
- To create the top tiers preheat the oven to 300ºF.
- Prepare the meringue following the method above.
- Place one large scoop of the meringue into a piping bag fitted with an open-star nozzle and pipe a large kiss/swirl, about 5cm in diameter on one side of one of the prepared baking trays. This swirl/kiss will be the final layer of the finished pavlova tower.
- Spread 1/3 of the remaining meringue into a round roughly 18cm in diameter onto the same baking sheet as the kiss. Spoon the remaining meringue onto another lined baking tray into another round roughly 25cm in diameter.
- Slide the meringues on the middle and bottom shelves of the preheated oven, immediately turn the temperature down to 200ºF and bake for 3 hours until the meringue is pale and crisp. Turn the oven off and leave the meringues to cool completely inside the oven.
- Meanwhile, make the raspberry cream by whipping the double cream until it will hold a soft peak. Stir through the raspberry conserve and tumble in the raspberries. Cover with cling film and chill in the fridge until needed.
- To make the lemon cream, whip the double cream to soft peaks. Fold through the mascarpone and lemon curd. Zest the lemons into long strands and fold through the cream. Cover with cling film and chill in the fridge until needed.
- When ready to serve, tip the soft fruits into a large bowl, sprinkle with the sugar and toss gently to combine.
- Take the largest meringue and brush the top with roughly 3 tablespoons of the melted white chocolate to create a seal. Repeat with the other two meringue layers and leave to set and the chocolate to harden.
- Place the largest meringue onto the serving plate and top with ¾ of the raspberry cream and ⅓ of the macerated soft fruits. Top with the second meringue layer, spoon over the lemon cream and another ⅓ of the soft fruits.
- Add the third meringue layer, spread with the remaining raspberry cream and soft fruits. Finally place the meringue kiss on top and decorate with rose petals or/and sugared almonds.
