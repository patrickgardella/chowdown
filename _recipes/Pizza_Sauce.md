yield: 2.25 cups
date: December 26 2019

ingredients:
- 1 (28-ounce) can San Marzano tomatoes (or the best quality you can find)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup grated onions (or finely diced for chunkier texture)
- 3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/4 -1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (depending on heat preference)
- 3 cloves garlic (grated or minced)
- 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons fish sauce or anchovy paste

directions:
- If your tomatoes are packed whole, pour them into a large bowl and using your hands break down the tomatoes so that they’re chunky but not completely liquidy. This can also be done with an immersion stick blender by just pulsing it a few times. Set aside.
- In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the olive oil, grated onions, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes. Allow the oil to cook the ingredients for 3-4 minutes, stirring as necessary. Add the garlic and continue to cook for another minute.
- Add the tomatoes from step #1, along with the sugar, salt, and fish sauce/ancovy paste. Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow the sauce to simmer for 30 minutes. Taste the sauce and adjust seasonings to preference. If you’d like a more concentrated tomato flavor, you can continue to simmer the sauce for an addition 15 minutes.
- Use the sauce for pizzas immediately or allow to come to room temperature before storing in containers. Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 3 months.
