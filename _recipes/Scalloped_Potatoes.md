ingredients:
- 1 1/4 lbs red potatoes, washed, but not peeled
- 1 1/4 lbs Yukon gold potatoes, washed, but not peeled
- 1 onion, sliced thinly
- 3 Tbsp butter
- 3 Tbsp all purpose flour
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dry mustard
- 1/4 tsp dried thyme
- 1/4 tsp paprika
- salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1 cup cheddar cheese shredded - 4 oz
- 1/2 cup gruyere cheese shredded - 2 oz
- 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese grated - 1 oz
- fresh chives, for garnish
- fresh parsley, for garnish
- additional 1/4 cup cheddar cheese, shredded - 1 oz
- additional 1/4 cup gruyere cheese, shredded - 1 oz
- additional 2 Tbsp Parmesan cheese, grated - 0.5 oz

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Butter a 2 quart casserole dish and set aside.  
- Slice potatoes in 1/8" thin slices (I use this mandoline slicer), and set aside.  
- Add butter to medium saucepan, and heat over MED heat.  When butter is melted, add garlic and saute for 1 minute, until fragrant.  Add flour, whisk, and cook 1 minute.  Slowly add milk, whisking continuously, until no lumps remain.  Whisk over MED heat until mixture is thick and coats the back of a spoon.
- Turn off heat, add cheeses, dry mustard, thyme, paprika, salt and pepper, and stir until smooth.
- Layer half the potatoes and onion slices in prepared casserole dish, pour approximately half of the cheese sauce over potatoes and let sit for a minute.  Repeat with remaining potatoes, onions, and cheese sauce.
- Sprinkle top of potatoes with gruyere, cheddar and Parmesan.  Spray aluminum foil with cooking spray, then cover the casserole dish (sprayed side down).  Place casserole on a baking sheet and bake for 60 minutes.
- Remove foil and bake uncovered an additional 25-30 minutes.  Potatoes should be tender and cheese melted.  Broil on HIGH for a minute or two for extra browning and crispiness.
- Sprinkle top with chives and parsley and serve.
