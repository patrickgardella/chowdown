ingredients: 
- 1/4 cup butter, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup vegetable or canola oil
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1-1/2 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1-1/2 cups chopped apple (about 2 medium-sized apples. I recommend Honeycrisp or Granny Smith)
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup old fashioned oats
- 1/4 cup flour
- 1/4 cup butter, at room temperature
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with liners then set aside.
- In a large bowl mix together butter, oil, sugars, and applesauce until combined, about 1 minute (mixture will look curdled.) Add egg and vanilla then mix to combine.
- In a separate bowl stir together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Remove 2 Tablespoons of the flour mixture then toss with the apples in a separate bowl to coat.
- Add remaining flour mixture to wet ingredients in two batches, mixing until just combined before adding the next batch. Fold in the apples. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups filling them 3/4 of the way full.
- For the crisp topping:  Mix ingredients (brown sugar, oats, flour, butter, and cinnamon) together in a small bowl until well combined. Sprinkle a heaping Tablespoon on top of each muffin then bake for 15-17 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in muffin tins for 10 minutes then remove to a cooling rack to cool completely.
