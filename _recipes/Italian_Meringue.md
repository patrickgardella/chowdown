cooktime: 20 min
totaltime: 20 min

ingredients:
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup water
- 4 tsp light corn syrup
- 4 large egg whites, room temperature
- 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla

directions:
- _*Before starting, make sure the egg whites are at room temperature._
- In a small pot (see notes), cook the sugar, water and corn syrup until it reaches the soft ball stage (240° F or 115° C).
- While the sugar is cooking, set up the mixer and egg whites.
- Place the room-temperature egg whites into the bowl of an electric mixer. Attach the wire whisk to the mixer. Add cream of tartar.
- Just as the sugar mixture reaches 240° F (or 115° C), turn the mixer on high speed.
- As the eggs whip, pour the hot sugar syrup in a slow, steady stream along the side of the bowl. Make sure to not pour the syrup onto the wire whisk. This will cause the syrup to splatter and cause lumps.
- Once all of the sugar syrup has been added, add vanilla. Continue to whip the meringue until it has cooled completely and has formed stiff peaks.
- Once the meringue has formed stiff peaks, pipe or use immediately for your dessert.

This very stable meringue can be used for meringue cakes and buttercreams and to top tarts or pies.

When making a small amount of sugar syrup, it is important to use a small pot. If you use a large pot, it will be too difficult to obtain an accurate thermometer reading if the syrup is spread too thin over the bottom of the pot. By using a smaller pot, you can better control and monitor the temperature to make sure you take the syrup off the heat as soon as it reaches 240° F.)

Some other helpful notes about making Italian meringue:

* Slightly older egg whites will whip up higher than fresh ones.
* Separate the eggs one at a time and then add them to the mixing bowl. If you run across a bad egg, or happen to break the yolk, you won't ruin the rest of the egg whites.
* Make sure all of your equipment is squeaky clean. If there is any trace of fat or dirt, the egg whites won't whip up to their maximum potential.
* For Meringue Cloud [Cookies](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/cookie/index.html): Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Dollop spoonfuls of meringue onto baking pans, alternatively you may use a [pastry bag](http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/pastry-bag/index.html) with a star tip. Bake for 2 hours until crisp. Turn off the oven and allow meringues to cool and completely dry out.
