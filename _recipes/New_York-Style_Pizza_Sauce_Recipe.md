preptime: 15 min
totaltime: 2 hours
serves: Makes enough for 2 to 4 (12-inch) pies, depending on how much sauce you like

ingredients:
- 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 medium cloves garlic, squished in garlic squisher (about 2 teaspoons)
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tsp Kosher salt
- 2 (6-inch) sprigs fresh basil with leaves attached
- 1 sprig of fresh thyme
- 1 medium yellow onion, peeled and split in half
- 1 tsp anchovy paste

directions:
- Process tomatoes and their juice through food mill, pulse in food processor until pureed, or puree with hand blender. Puree should not be completely smooth, but should have no chunks larger than 1/16 of an inch. Set tomatoes aside.
- combine butter and oil in medium saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Add garlic, oregano, pepper flakes, and salt and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil sprigs, thyme sprig, onion halves, and anchovy paste.
- Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to lowest setting (bubbles should barely be breaking the surface), and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by 1/2, about 1 hour.
- Discard onions and basil stems. Season to taste with salt. Allow to cool and store in covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
