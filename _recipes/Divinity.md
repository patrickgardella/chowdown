ingredients:
- 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup light corn syrup
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 2 egg whites, at room temperature
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- 1 teaspoon vanilla

directions:
- Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silpat mat and set aside.
- In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, water, corn syrup and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, just until the mixture starts to boil.  Then clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan and continue to cook without stirring until the temperature reaches 260 degrees F, about 8-10 minutes.
- While the sugar mixture is cooking, beat the egg whites on high speed using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment until stiff peaks form.  
- Once the sugar mixture reaches 260 degrees, remove from heat and very slowly pour it in a thin, steady stream, over the egg whites while mixing on high speed.  It should take about 2 minutes to pour the hot liquid over the egg whites, so go slow and don't rush this step.  
- Continue to beat on high speed for another 5-8 minutes until the candy loses some of its glossiness and starts to hold its shape.  You can stop mixing and test a small amount of candy by dropping a small spoonful of it onto the parchment paper to see if it holds its shape in a nice mound with nice swirls on top or if it melts down into a puddle.  Continue to beat a minute or two longer if the divinity doesn't hold its shape yet, test again.
- Mix in the vanilla and the chopped pecans when the candy stays in a mound instead of melting into itself.
- Using two spoons sprayed lightly with cooking spray, drop tablespoon size scoops of divinity onto the prepared baking sheet, using one spoon to scrape the hot candy off the other spoon.  You will want to work quickly while the candy is still hot.
- Let the candy set for 2-3 hours, then store for up to 5 days in an airtight container.

The trickiest part to making this old fashioned divinity candy recipe is knowing when it is done and ready to be dropped into little mounds or poured into a pan to set. But I have two tests to help you out.

The first test is by just turning off your mixer and lifting the beaters. If the candy falls back into the bowl in ribbons that immediately merge back into themselves, the divinity is not done and you need to keep beating.

Eventually, the divinity will lose it’s glossiness and sheen and stop being so sticky, which means it’s ready.

The second test is even easier, I think, because all you do if you are having a hard time telling whether the divinity is still glossy in the first test is to go ahead and stop the mixer, drop a teaspoonful of candy onto wax paper, and check whether the candy will hold its shape.

If it puddles, the divinity isn’t ready, but if it holds a peak and stays in a nice mound, you are good to go.

If the divinity gets too thick, try adding a few drops of hot water then beating again to save it.

Cherry Divinity:
1 12 oz jar marachino cherries, drained, diced (1/2 to 1/3 cup pieces).
Squeeze the chopped cherries between a couple layers of paper towels to remove any excess juice.
When the divinity is ready, work quickly and fold in the chopped maraschino cherries using a rubber spatula, then drop small spoonfuls of divinity onto the parchment paper.
