ingredients:
- Baking spray with flour 
- 3 cups all-purpose flour 
- 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed 
- 3/4 cup unsifted powdered sugar 
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 4 large eggs

- Prepare the Crust: Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 13- x 9-inch baking pan with baking spray with flour. Line bottom and sides of pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2- to 3-inch overhang on 2 sides. Place flour, butter, powdered sugar, and salt in a food processor.
