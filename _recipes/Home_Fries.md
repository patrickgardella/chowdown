ingredients:
- 2 large russet potatoes, diced into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 quart of water
- 1 tablespoon fine sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 tablespoons bacon grease (or any other fat you prefer)

directions:
- Bring a quart of water with 1 tablespoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda to a boil. In the meantime, dice the potatoes. Once the water is boiling, add the potatoes, then let the water return to a boil. Let them cook for about five minutes, until the potato pieces can be easily pierced with a knife. Remove the potatoes from the water with a spider or a sieve, then place them in a large nonstick pan. (Do not use a stainless steel pan, as it will steal your delicious potato crust, no matter how much oil you use.) Heat the pan over high heat and let some of the moisture from the potatoes evaporate for a minute. Add the grease, and give everything a stir with a wooden spoon or spatula to evenly coat the potatoes. Than let the potatoes cook until a crispy crust forms, 20-30 minutes, flipping every once in a while to make sure they donâ€™t burn. Serve immediately.
