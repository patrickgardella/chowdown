ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons butter or extra virgin olive oil
- 2-4 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes*, or more/less to taste
- 1 small yellow or red onion, finely diced
- 6 large cloves garlic, minced or pressed
- 2 (28-ounce) cans whole tomatoes, preferably San Marzano
- 1/2 cup packed fresh basil leaves, torn or roughly-chopped
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper

directions:
- Heat butter or olive oil in a large saucepan (or deep sauté pan) over medium-high heat until melted.  Add crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add onions and sauté for 5 minutes or until softened and translucent, stirring occasionally.  Add garlic and sauté for 2 more minutes or until fragrant, stirring occasionally.  Add in the tomatoes and stir to combine.
- Continue cooking the sauce, breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon (or potato masher) as you go, until the sauce reaches a low simmer.  Reduce heat to medium to maintain a steady simmer.  Then let the sauce continue to cook uncovered for about 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it has thickened** and reached your desired consistency.
- Stir in the basil, salt and pepper.  Then taste the sauce, and season with any extra salt, pepper and/or crushed red pepper flakes as needed.
- Serve immediately.  Or let the sauce cool and then refrigerate it in a sealed container for up to 4 days.

This Spicy Arrabbiata Sauce recipe is super-simple to make, calls for just 6 main ingredients, and is guaranteed to kick your pasta nights up a delicious notch.

BATCH SIZE: This arrabbiata recipe makes a pretty large batch (which will yield a nice saucy pasta, if tossed with a 1-lb box of pasta which has been cooked according to package instructions).  So if you are cooking less pasta, or if you prefer a less-saucy pasta, feel free to halve the recipe.

-CRUSHED RED PEPPER FLAKES: I like to add 4 teaspoons (or more!) of crushed red pepper flakes to this recipe, which definitely gives it a noticeable kick.  But if you are sensitive to heat, I would start with 1 or 2 teaspoons and you can always add more later.

-CONSISTENCY: If the sauce accidentally thickens too much to your liking, you can thin it out with water (ideally some starchy pasta water) — either in the pan of sauce itself, or you can add the water directly to the pasta once it has been mixed with the sauce.
