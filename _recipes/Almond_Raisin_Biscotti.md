ingredients:
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- 2 eggs beaten
- ⅓ cup butter
- 2 tbsp. water
- 1 tsp almond extract
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup light or sultana raisins
- 1 cup whole almonds
- 1 extra egg yolk mixed with a little water
- 2 ½ cups flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 extra egg yolk mixed with a little water

directions:
- Cream butter and sugars and add eggs one at a time until well creamed. Add almond and vanilla flavorings.
- Sift together dry ingredients and add to creamed mixture along with raisins and almonds.
- Separate dough in 3 portions and form into a baguette shaped loaf on a parchment lined cookie sheet. These will about double in size when baked so leave sufficient room on your cookie sheet
- Brush tops with egg yolk and water mixture (you need not use it all) and sprinkle with 3 or 4 tablespoons of sugar.
- Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes or until brown all over and the center is slightly firm. Cool slightly on rack.
- Slice cookies diagonally with a sharp knife and place slices on an ungreased cookie sheet in a 300 degree oven for 15-20 minutes more, turning them once.
- Turn off oven and leave for an hour. Cool completely. Store in an airtight container and these cookies will keep for several weeks.
- You can dip some in melted chocolate if you like.

After trying several biscotti recipes over the years, this is my own almond raisin biscotti version of these traditional Italian cookies.  These almond raisin biscotti are twice baked and quite crispy , making them well suited to dipping in coffee (especially espresso) or even sweet wine. I like to dip mine in Italian Limoncello Liqueur. These will keep for weeks in an airtight container. This is another ideal recipe for gift giving as well. There are a couple of select recipients on my list who will receive a few of these in a cellophane bag tied with a festive ribbon. Dipping them in chocolate is of course, optional. Well, for some people anyway.

Twice baked cookies that are perfect for dipping into coffee, tea or even red wine or Italian liqueurs.
