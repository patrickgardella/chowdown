ingredients:
- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- 4 slices thick-cut bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices (about 1/2 cup)
- 4 whole chicken legs (drumsticks and thighs)
- 1/4 cup brandy
- 8 carrots, peeled and cut on an angle into 2-inch pieces
- 4 bay leaves
- 3 tbsp. flour
- 3 cloves garlic, grated
- 2 cups dry red wine
- About 2 cups beef stock
- 1 cup white mushrooms, halved
- Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish

directions:
- In a large pot with a lid, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the bacon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towelâ€“lined plate to drain.
- Season the chicken with salt and pepper and add to the bacon drippings in the pot. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Add the brandy to the pot and stir to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Simmer until reduced by half, 1 to 2 minutes. Return the chicken to the pot. Add the carrots and bay leaves. Cover and cook over medium-low heat for 10 minutes.
- Uncover the pot. Sprinkle the flour on top of the chicken and stir gently. Cover and cook until the flour is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
- Add the reserved bacon and the garlic. Add the wine and enough stock to just cover the chicken. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until the chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Divide among shallow bowls. Top with parsley.
