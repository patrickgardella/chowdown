prep_time: 15 min
cook_time: 1 hour
total_time: 1 hr 15 min
tags: Salad, Keeper
yield: 16 servings
date: July 7 2019

ingredients:
- 4 lbs Red Bliss potatoes
- 5 large eggs
- 1⁄2 cup finely chopped green onion top
- 1 1⁄4 cups mayonnaise (real - not olive oil or other oils)
- 2 teaspoons celery seeds
- 2 teaspoons salt

directions:
- Steam the potatoes skin-on for approximately 45 minutes (you can boil them, but they tend to be slightly mushier in the end result). Set aside until cool enough to handle. Boil your eggs, then do the same. When cool enough, peel the eggs ONLY (do NOT peel the potatoes -- the skin gives it part of it's unique texture and taste).
- In a large bowl, mix the remaining ingredients together until thoroughly mixed. Chop the potatoes and eggs into bite-size pieces and add to bowl. Mix GENTLY -- you want salad, not mush -- until blended.
- Serve at room temp for up to 2 hours after making -- refridgerate leftovers. It tastes best when room temp, but is delicious cold too -- so if you are making this in advance, it's fine to chill it.
