ingredients:
- ¼ Cup warm Water 
- 1 Tablespoon Sugar  
- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast 
- ¾ Cup warm Milk  
- 3/4 Cup Greek Yogurt  
- 4 Cups all-purpose Flour  
- 1 teaspoon Salt 
- ½ Cup salted Butter (melted) 
- 5 cloves of Garlic (minced) 
- 2 Tablespoons of unsalted butter 
- Fresh Cilantro

directions:
- In a medium bowl combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let sit until foamy (takes about 5-10 minutes).
- While you are waiting, in a large bowl add in your flour and salt and mix till combined.
- Whisk in the warm milk and plain yogurt together gently. Once combined, add the yeast mixture into the milk and yogurt mixture and stir until well-combined.
- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until a loose dough is formed.
- Turn out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until smooth, about 3-4 minutes (it will come together even though it doesn't seem like it). 
- Transfer the dough to a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover loosely with a towel. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size this takes about 1 hour.
- Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead briefly into a disc to allow an easy cut. 
- Cut the dough into 12 equal-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.
- Heat a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat and once hot, add in 2 Tablespoons of unsalted butter. Roll each dough ball out until it is about 1/4-inch-thick. Brush the dough lightly with melted salted butter and place one at a time onto the hot skillet.
- Cook until large bubbles form on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip the dough and cook the other side until golden, about 1-2 more minutes. Stack the cooked flat bread on a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm as you cook the remaining pieces.
- Add the minced garlic to the remaining melted butter and heat for 30 seconds on the stove top. Brush the warm naan with the garlic butter and top with cilantro.
