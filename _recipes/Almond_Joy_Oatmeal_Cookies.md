ingredients:
- 1 c (100g)  oats
- ¾ c (90g) whole wheat flour
- 1 ½ tsp (4g) baking powder
- ½ tsp (1g) cinnamon
- 1/8 tsp (1g) salt
- 2 tbsp (28g) coconut oil or unsalted butter, melted
- 1 large egg, room temperature
- ¾ tsp (4mL) almond extract
- ½ c (120mL) agave (½ cup of brown sugar + 5 tablespoons of milk.)
- 2 tbsp (10g) shredded unsweetened coconut
- 2 tbsp (28g) finely chopped dark chocolate

directions:
- Whisk together the oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the coconut oil or butter, egg, and almond extract. Stir in the agave. Add in the flour mixture, stirring just until incorporated. Fold in the coconut and a little over half of the chocolate. Chill for 30 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 325°F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
- Drop the cookie dough into 15 rounded scoops onto the prepared sheet. Press the remaining chocolate into the tops, and flatten slightly. Bake at 325°F for 12-15 minutes. Cool on the pan for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack.

These almond-flavored oatmeal cookies are filled with shredded coconut and chocolate, the same flavors as are in Almond Joy candy bars. They’re incredibly soft & chewy, and they’ll stay that way for an entire week if stored in an airtight container. But… They never last that long!

Notes: It’s extremely important to measure the oats correctly. They should be measured like flour. If scooped directly from the container, you’ll end up with 1.5 times as many oats, which will make the cookies dry and crumbly, as well as prevent them from spreading in the oven.

Honey or maple syrup may be substituted in place of the agave.

Miniature chocolate chips may be substituted in place of the dark chocolate.
