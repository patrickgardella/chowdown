serves: 8

ingredients:
- 4 slices bacon, chopped
- 12oz andouille sausage (use kielbasa if sensitive to spice,) chopped
- 2 chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- salt and pepper
- 1 small yellow onion, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 ribs celery, chopped
- 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning (see notes)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 Tablespoons all-purpose flour 
- 32oz chicken broth
- 28oz crushed tomatoes
- 2 cups water
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 cup long grain white rice

directions:
- Add bacon to a large, 6-quart Dutch Oven or heavy soup pot then place on the stove and turn heat to medium. Cook until bacon is crisp then remove bacon to a plate and set aside, reserving bacon fat in the pot. If necessary, add enough extra virgin olive oil to total 2 Tablespoons fat in the pot.
- Turn heat up to medium-high then add sausage and chicken, season with salt and pepper, then saute until chicken begins to turn opaque, 2 minutes. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery, season with Cajun seasoning, then saute until vegetables are tender, 5 minutes, turning heat up if necessary to keep ingredients sizzling. Add garlic then saute for 30 seconds.
- Sprinkle flour over the meat and vegetables then stir to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add chicken broth a splash at a time while stirring to create a smooth sauce, then add crushed tomatoes, water, and bay leaves. Turn heat up to high to bring liquid to a boil then add rice and stir well. Turn heat down to medium-low then cover and simmer until rice is al dente, 15-18 minutes, stirring often. When rice has a couple minutes left until it's tender, remove the pot from the heat then let sit with the lid on for 2-3 minutes to let the rice finish cooking from the heat of the pot. Remove the lid then let soup sit and thicken for 10 minutes before ladling into bowls and serving.

* If serving this recipe to children or someone who's sensitive to spice, start with 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning then add up to 1 additional teaspoon seasoning at the end until desired heat level is reached.
* I use [Emeril's Essence](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/emerils-essence-recipe.html) for the Cajun seasoning, which I highly recommend!
