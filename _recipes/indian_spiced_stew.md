yield: 8 servings

ingredients:
- 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil
- 3 large chicken breasts, skin on, bone-in (or can use boneless)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 Tbsp. finely grated ginger
- 2 Tbsp. tomato paste
- 2 tsp. garam masala
- 2 tsp. ground cumin
- 2 tsp. ground turmeric
- 1 1/2 tsp. ground coriander
- 1/2 – 3/4 tsp. cayennne pepper (depending on how spicy, you like it or you can omit)3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 
- 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth (plus a bit more, for thinning, if necessary)
- 3/4 cup tomato purée
- 1/2 cup heavy cream (can use a lighter cream)
- 1/2 pound small Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced 1/4″ thick or small fingerlings, sliced in half lengthwise

directions:
- Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper and place skin side down in to the pan. Cook until golden brown without turning, about 8–10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.
- To the same pot, add onion, garlic, and ginger to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is very soft and golden brown, about 8–10 minutes. Add tomato paste, garam masala, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste is beginning to darken, about 4 minutes.
- Add chicken pieces, chicken broth, tomato purée, and cream to pot. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until chicken is almost falling off the bone and liquid is slightly thickened, about 1 1/2 hours. If using bone-in chicken, remove chicken to a plate and carefully remove chicken from the bone and discard skin and bones. Cut or pull chicken into bite-sized pieces. Return chicken pieces to the pot.
- Add potatoes to the pot and cook, partially covered, until potatoes are fork-tender and sauce is thickened, 30-45 minutes. -Check and stir every so often to ensure the sauce hasn’t thickened to much and potatoes aren’t sticking to the bottom of the pot. If sauce is too thick, thin with a bit more chicken stock. 
- To serve, spoon stew into a shallow bowl and place a large dollop of yogurt on one side. Sprinkle with some fresh chopped mint, cilantro or parsley and serve with naan bread on the side. Alternately, spoon stew over some warm basmati rice.
