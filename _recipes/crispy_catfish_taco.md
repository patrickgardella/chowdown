These oven “fried” catfish filets are just as crispy as pan-fried filets but a lot less messy to make. The tender, tasty fish is soaked in buttermilk and covered in panko breadcrumbs flavored with Cajun seasoning. If catfish is not available, use any firm white fish such as cod, tilapia, or grouper.
