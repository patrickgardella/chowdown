ingredients:

- 2 lbs. beef cubes, trimmed
- 2 Tbsp. olive oil
- 2 Tbsp. butter
- 2 onions, chopped fine
- 2 Tbsp. white or cider vinegar
- Salt and pepper
- A few pinches of all-purpose flour
- 2 beef bouillon cubes, dissolved in 2 cups water
- Hungarian paprika, to taste (I usually shake in about 2 Tbsp.)
- A long squirt of ketchup

directions:
- Sauté onions in olive oil and butter in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven until glossy. Add vinegar at the end to deglaze the pot. Remove onions to separate bowl, but do not drain the pot. Add beef cubes and brown them over medium heat. While they’re cooking, sprinkle some flour over the meat, but not much more than a few pinches.
- Add onions back to the pot, along with ketchup, bouillon water, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cover and let simmer, stirring occasionally until cooked through. Serve over spaetzle or egg noodles.
