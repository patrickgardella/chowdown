ingredients:

- 1 3 pound boneless beef chuck pot roast
- 1 1/2 cups chopped jicama or celery
- 1/2 cup chopped green onions (4)
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon chili oil
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons cold water
- 24 butter head (Boston or Bibb) lettuce leaves
- Coarsely chopped cashews (optional)

directions:
- 1. Trim fat from meat. If necessary, cut meat to fit into a 3-1/2- or 4-quart slow cooker. Place meat in cooker. In a medium bowl combine jicama, green onions, vinegar, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, ginger, salt, chili oil, and pepper. Pour over meat.
- 2. Cover and cook on low-heat setting for 8 to 10 hours or on high-heat setting for 4 to 5 hours.
- 3. If using low-heat setting, turn to high-heat setting. In a small bowl combine cornstarch and the cold water; stir into soy sauce mixture. Cover and cook about 15 minutes more or until thickened.
- 4. Remove meat from cooker, reserving cooking juices. Using two forks, pull meat apart into shreds.
- 5. Spoon meat mixture onto lettuce leaves. Fold bottom edge of each lettuce leaf up and over filling. Fold in opposite sides; secure with a cocktail pick. Serve wraps with the reserved cooking juices and, if desired, cashews.
