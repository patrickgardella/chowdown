ingredients:
- 1/2 cup warm water (100°F to 110°F)
- 1 (1/4-oz.) pkg. active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp.)
- 1 teaspoon plus 3 Tbsp. granulated sugar, divided
- 5 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 cup cold salted butter, cubed
- 1/2 cup cold shortening, cubed
- 2 cups whole buttermilk
- 6 tablespoons salted butter, melted and divided

directions:
- Stir together warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Let stand 5 minutes.
- Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl; cut cold butter and cold shortening into flour mixture with a pastry blender or 2 forks until crumbly. Add yeast mixture and buttermilk to flour mixture, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; chill at least 2 hours or up to 5 days.
- Preheat oven to 400°F. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 3 or 4 times. Gently roll into a 1⁄2-inch-thick circle, and fold in half; repeat. Gently roll to 1⁄2-inch thickness; cut with a 2-inch round cutter. Reroll remaining scraps, and cut with cutter. Place rounds with sides touching in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet or on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. (If using a 12-inch skillet, place remaining biscuits in a 10-inch skillet or on a baking sheet.) Brush biscuits with 3 tablespoons of the melted butter.
- Bake in preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Brush with remaining 3 tablespoons melted butter, and serve.

Honestly, these angel biscuits come by their name because they taste like they’re sent right from heaven to our plate. One Test Kitchen professional said these “addictive” biscuits are “light and airy with the yeasty flavor of a dinner roll.” It’s a flaky and light cross between a buttermilk biscuit and a Parker House roll, and they can be prepared one week in advance to make your holiday cooking schedule a little less stressful. For making this recipe ahead, just throw together the dough and store in refrigerator until ready to bake. You might even be able to convince the kids to behave like angels in order to get an Angel Biscuit this Thanksgiving.
