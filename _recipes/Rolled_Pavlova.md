ingredients:
- 8 3/4 ounces egg whites (from about 7 large eggs), at room temperature (they whisk better if not fridge-cold)
- 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 2/3 cups heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, sifted, plus extra to dust
- 7-8 plums, washed but unpeeled, pitted and cut into 1/4-inch wide segments (1 lb 5 ounces)
- 10 1/2 ounces fresh blackberries
- 1/2 cup toasted sliced almonds

directions:
- To make the meringue base, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a 15 x 10-inch jelly-roll pan or similar size shallow baking pan with parchment paper, so the paper rises 3⁄4-inch over the sides of the pan.
- Place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment in place and beat on medium-high speed for about 1 minute, until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating all the time for 5 minutes, until the mixture turns into a thick and glossy meringue. Turn the speed to low and add the vanilla extract, vinegar and cornstarch. Increase the speed to medium and beat for a minute, until fully combined.
- Spoon the meringue into the lined pan and use a spatula to spread it out evenly. Place in the preheated oven and immediately lower the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit; the contrast in temperature helps create the crisp outside along with the gooey marshmallow-like inside. Bake for about 35 minutes, until the meringue is pale beige in color and crusty on top. Remove from the oven and set aside in the pan until completely cool. The meringue will have puffed up in the oven but will deflate slightly when cooled. If keeping until the next day, the meringue can be covered with a kitchen towel and set aside at room temperature.
- To make the filling, using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed, beat the cream until very soft peaks form — this should take about 1 minute, longer if whisking by hand. Add the vanilla extract and confectioners' sugar and whisk to incorporate.
- Place a clean kitchen towel flat on top of the meringue (or use the one that is already there, if you've made this the day before) and quickly but carefully invert it onto the work surface, so that the crisp top of the meringue is now facing down and sitting on top of the kitchen towel. Lift the pan off and carefully peel away the parchment paper before spreading the meringue evenly with two-thirds of the whipped cream. Cover generously with 1 lb 2 ounces of the plums and 7 ounces of the blackberries, and sprinkle with 1/3 cup of the almonds.
- Starting with the longest side closest to you, and using the kitchen towel to assist, roll the meringue up and over, so that the edges come together to form a log. Gently pull away the kitchen towel as you roll, then slide the meringue onto a long tray or platter, seam side facing down. Don't worry if the meringue loses its shape a bit or some of the fruit spills out; just hold your nerve and use your hands to pat it back into the shape of the log.
- Pipe or spoon the remaining whipped cream down the length of the log. Top with the remaining fruit and almonds, dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.

Pavlova is a meringue filled with cream and fruit. Ottolenghi's version looks like a Swiss roll and it's light because meringue has a lot of air in it. "Around Christmas, I use red currants, maybe some passion fruit, citrus but it doesn't matter what fruit you use," he says. The version below uses plums and blackberries. "It looks sensational because the meringue cracks and it looks like a yule log, where the meringue is the bark of the tree. And as soon as you dust it with a bit of powdered sugar, it really looks the part."

Make ahead

The meringue base (unfilled) can be prepared up to a day ahead. Leave it in the pan and drape with a kitchen towel until needed. You are then ready to fill it with the fruit and cream up to 4 hours before (but ideally as close as possible to) serving.

Storage

This should be eaten on the day it is assembled and served, although leftovers can be stored in the fridge and eaten cold.
