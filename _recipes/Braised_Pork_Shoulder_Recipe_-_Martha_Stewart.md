ingredients:
- 6 ounces pancetta, finely chopped
- 2 medium onions, thinly sliced
- 1 bone-in pork shoulder (6 to 7 pounds), skin on (if making potatoes), room temperature
- Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 head garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons fennel seeds, toasted and ground
- 1 teaspoon crushed coriander seeds
- 2 cups Belgian-style ale
- 1 cup homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock

directions:
- Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Crisp pancetta in a large Dutch oven over medium-low heat, until fat is rendered, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon.
- Add onions to Dutch oven. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 25 minutes. Transfer to plate using slotted spoon.
- Season pork with salt and pepper. Add oil to Dutch oven, and sear pork, fat side down, until golden, about 5 minutes. Flip, and repeat.
- Add garlic and spices to pot. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ale, stock, pancetta, and onions; bring to a simmer. Transfer to oven, and braise pork, covered, basting every hour, until meat is falling off the bone, about 4 hours. Shred meat (just what you're using) using 2 forks, and drizzle with warm skimmed jus.

Serving idea: Pile shredded pork on creamy polenta. Drizzle with jus.

For leftovers: Cut away and reserve skin if making [potatoes](http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/roasted-baby-potatoes-with-cracklings-and-chives). Refrigerate pork in jus with onions overnight; skim fat from top (reserve if making potatoes). Reheat pork in oven, and shred just before using. You'll need shredded meat and skimmed jus for all three recipes.

From Cook’s Illustrated:

Bacon and pancetta are both cut from the belly of the pig, but the products are not identical. Bacon is cured with salt, then smoked and sliced. Pancetta (sometimes called Italian bacon) is cured with salt, black pepper, and spices and rolled into a cylinder. It is never smoked.

Replacing pancetta with bacon won’t ruin a dish, but because bacon is overtly smoky, many recipes recommend blanching it before swapping it for pancetta. To test the validity of this practice, we made our recipes for Hearty Tuscan Bean Stew and Pasta with Greens and Beans, first blanching bacon in boiling water, then proceeding with the recipe, subbing the blanched bacon for pancetta.

As we prepared the recipes, we noticed that blanching had removed a considerable amount of the fat from the bacon. In fact, for the stew recipe, we had to supplement the bacon with a small amount of oil to properly sauté the aromatics. And when we tasted the finished dishes, we noticed that despite the blanching, subtle hints of smokiness remained. Even so, tasters deemed the substitution acceptable.

Our conclusion: If you want to eliminate most of its smoky flavor, blanch bacon in boiling water for two minutes before swapping it for pancetta. Because blanched bacon is not as fatty as pancetta, you may need to add extra oil to the recipe.
