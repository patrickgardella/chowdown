ingredients:
- 1 sticks butter
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 tablespoon milk
- A dash of mint extract (to flavor)
- A few drops of green food coloring (or any other color if you want to get festive)
- 2 stick of butter
- 2 Cup of chocolate chips

directions:
- Melt a stick of butter and a cup of chocolate chips in the microwave at 50% power (may vary based on microwave) until soft enough to blend 
- Whip the newly formed chocolatey butter until smooth
- Pour evenly into a pan of your choice and spread evenly
- Insert into freezer while you are creating your other layers. The freezing process is done so that adding layers doesn't destroy the integrity of those underneath. Please make sure that the layer is sufficiently cooled and hardened before adding more. 
- Melt yet another stick of butter
- Mix with one cup powdered sugar
- Add one tablespoon of milk
- Add a few drops of mint extract until the previously made paste is sufficiently minty. 
- Add a some drops of green (or any other food coloring) to the paste until it is a color of your liking
- Mix. 
- Remove the previously made chocolate layer from the freezer
- Test if the chocolate mixture has congealed enough to take pressure
- If not put back into freezer and wait. Go read a book or something
- If so, pour Mint Icing onto chocolatey layer making sure to spread evenly
- Return it back to reezer
- Remove the dually layered bar out of the freezer
- Once again test the surface with a spoon or other prodding device for tensile strength
- If it is chilled enough to take another layer continue, if not return it to the freezer and wait
- Add your last layer! You are almost to the point were your taste buds get to dance majestically in the mint chocolate waves

Allow the bar to acclimate to room temperature and solidify a bit more before cutting **.** Make your own judgements on this one.

The great thing I love about this recipe is it allows for anyone to use it for any sort of dessert. You could even make one or two layers to top a cake or your favorite Ben & Jerry's Icecream. Just remember to have fun and clean up when you are finished.
