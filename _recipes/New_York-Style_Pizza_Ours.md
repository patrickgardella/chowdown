ingredients:
- 22.5 ounces (about 4 1/2 cups) bread flour, plus more for dusting
- .5 ounces (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) sugar
- .35 ounces kosher salt (about 1 teaspoon)
- .35 ounces (about 2 teaspoons) instant yeast
- 1.125 ounces Extra Virgin olive oil (about 3 tablespoons)
- 15 ounces lukewarm water

directions:
- Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of bread maker. 
- Set for dough cycle
- It should pass the [windowpane test](http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2010/09/technique-the-windowpane-test-for-pizza-dough.html). Divide dough into three even parts and place each in a covered quart-sized deli container or in a zipper-lock freezer bag. 
- Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least one day, and up to 5.
- At least two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and shape into balls by gathering dough towards bottom and pinching shut. Flour well and place each one in a separate medium mixing bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at warm room temperature until roughly doubled in volume.
- 1 hour before baking, adjust oven rack with pizza stone to middle position and preheat oven to 500Â°F. Turn single dough ball out onto lightly flour surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer 1-inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles into a 12 to 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.
- Spread approximately 2/3 cup of sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2 to 1-inch border along edge. Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese over sauce. Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until cheese is melted with some browned spots and crust is golden brown and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes total. Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately.
