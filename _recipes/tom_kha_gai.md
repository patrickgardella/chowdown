ingredients:

- 2 stalks fresh lemongrass, tough outer layers removed
- 2 tablespoons grated (or finely-chopped) fresh ginger
- 1/4 cup fresh lime juice or 10 kaffir lime leaves*
- 6 cups good-quality chicken stock
- 4 green onions, thinly-sliced with the white and green parts separated
- 2 cups cooked shredded chicken
- 8 ounces white, shiitake, or oyster mushrooms (or you could use a combination of your favorites), sliced
- 2 (13.5-ounce) cans coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1-3 teaspoons coconut sugar, to taste (or use another favorite sweetener)
- toppings: fresh cilantro, thinly-sliced Thai red chiles**, fresh lime wedges, etc.

directions:

- Using the back of a knife, lightly smash the lemongrass on a cutting board.  Cut the lemongrass into 1-inch pieces, and add to a large stockpot.
- Add lemongrass, ginger, fresh lime juice (or kaffir lime leaves), chicken broth, and the white parts of the green onions to the stockpot, and stir to combine.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Strain out the broth and discard the solids, then return the broth to the stockpot.
- Add cooked chicken, mushrooms, coconut milk, fish sauce, and sugar, and stir to combine.  Increase heat to medium-high until it reaches a simmer, then continue cooking for 1-2 more minutes until the mushrooms are cooked and softened, stirring occasionally.  Taste and season with salt and pepper, if needed.
- Serve immediately, garnished liberally with your desired toppings and the green parts of the green onions.
- *Kaffir limes offer a more complex/authentic flavor to this dish, but can be hard to find.  So if they’re unavailable at your local store, feel free to just use fresh lime juice.
- **If you can’t find fresh chiles, you can sub in some hot chili oil or sriracha, or even some crushed red chile flakes.
- ***I also adding a few vegetables, such as thinly-sliced red bell peppers and split peas, to this soup for extra color and nutrition.  If you’d like to add these, just add them along with the chicken/mushrooms/etc., and let the soup continue to simmer until they’re cooked through.
