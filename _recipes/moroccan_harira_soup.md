ingredients:
- 2 cans whole peeled tomatoes (28-ounce cans), drained and chopped

- 1 yellow onion diced
- 4 cloves garlic minced

- Saute the onion and garlic in the oil until the onion is soft and translucent (5 to 6 minutes).
- To the pot, add the kefta seasoning, ground cumin, cayenne pepper powder, and salt. Stir to coat the onion and garlic and allow the seasonings to heat (1 to 2 minute).
