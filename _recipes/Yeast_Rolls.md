ingredients:
- 2 packages yeast
- 2⁄3 cup warm water
- ¼ cup soft butter
- 1 cup warm milk
- 1½ teaspoons salt
- ½ cup sugar
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 5-6 cups flour
- Approximately 1½ sticks melted butter for dipping

directions:
- Combine yeast and warm water in a large bowl.
- On the stovetop in a medium-sized pan mix together the butter and milk until the butter melts.
- Add salt and sugar to the yeast mixture, and then stir in the eggs.
- Alternate adding 2 cups of flour and the milk and butter mixture into the yeast mixture. Gradually add the rest of the flour, stirring continuously.
- Sprinkle flour on the counter, turn out the dough, and roll it into a ball. (You may need to knead the dough a little more.)
- Cover ball with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let set 20 minutes. Pat down dough to about ½ inch thick.
- Pour some of the melted butter into bottom of a 9x13-inch glass dish. Cut out each roll with a biscuit cutter, dip in butter, and place in dish. (This recipe usually will make enough rolls to fill both a 9x13-inch and an 8x8-inch dish.)
- Cover rolls with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Take out of the refrigerator and let set 15 minutes. Uncover before baking.
- Bake at 375 degrees for 25 minutes.
