ingredients:
- European cucumber or 3 Persian cucumbers, finely chopped or grated
- Salt
- 2 cups lowfat drained yogurt
- 2 to 3 garlic cloves, cut in half, green shoots removed, and mashed to a paste in a mortar and pestle with 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint (more to taste)
- Freshly ground pepper
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (optional)

directions:
- Line a strainer with a double thickness of cheesecloth and set it over a bowl. Place the yogurt in the strainer, and refrigerate for at least two hours (preferably four hours or longer). Transfer to a covered container and refrigerate again. 
- Toss the cucumber with a generous amount of salt and leave in a colander in the sink to wilt for 15 to 30 minutes. Rinse and drain on paper towels.
- Beat together the yogurt, garlic, mint, salt and pepper to taste, and olive oil. Stir in the cucumbers. Adjust seasonings and serve.
