ingredients:
- 1 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves 
- 1/2 cup fresh orange juice 
- 1/2 cup fresh lime juice 
- 9 garlic cloves, finely chopped 
- 3 tablespoons finely chopped oregano 
- 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
- Kosher salt 
- Pepper 
- 1 5-pound, boneless pork shoulder roast with fat cap 
- Lime wedges, for serving

directions:
- In a large, sturdy resealable plastic bag, combine the cilantro, orange and lime juices, garlic, oregano, olive oil, 2 tablespoons of kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Add the pork shoulder, seal the bag and turn to coat. Transfer the bag to a large baking dish and refrigerate the pork overnight, turning the bag once or twice.
- Remove the pork from the marinade and scrape off the garlic and herbs; discard the marinade. Season the pork all over with salt and pepper and transfer to a large enameled cast-iron casserole. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.
- Preheat the oven to 400°. Roast the pork fat side up for 1 hour, until lightly browned. Reduce the oven temperature to 300° and roast for 4 hours longer, until the pork is very tender and the fat cap is crispy; transfer to a carving board and let rest for 30 minutes. Chop the fat cap into bite-size pieces. Carve, shred or pull apart the pork and garnish with the crispy cap pieces. Serve with lime wedges.

Chef Jose Enrique’s version of the Puerto Rican classic pernil is extra-flavorful because he marinates the pork in lime and orange juices, as well as plenty of garlic, before roasting until the meat is caramelized and crispy. It can be carved, shredded or pulled into large pieces for serving.

The roast pork can be refrigerated overnight; rewarm in a 300° oven.

Serve With Black beans and rice.
