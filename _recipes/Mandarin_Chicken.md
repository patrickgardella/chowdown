- 2/3 cup granulated sugar

- 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger

- 6 skinless chicken thigh fillets

directions:
- Combine the sugar, soy sauce, lemon juice, oil, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan. Combine the water with arrowroot in a small bowl and stir until the arrowroot is dissolved. Add this mixture to the saucepan and turn the heat to high. Stir often while bringing the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 4&nbsp; to 6 minutes or until the sauce is thick.
- Preheat your grill on high for the chicken.
- When the grill is hot, rub each chicken piece with oil and cook the chicken for 4 to 6 minutes per side or until completely cooked. Chicken should have browned in spots.
- When the chicken is done, chop it into bite-size pieces. Pour the chicken pieces into a large frying pan over medium heat. Heat until the chicken sizzles then reduce heat and cover the chicken until ready to serve. Spoon the chicken into a medium bowl, then pour all the sauce over the chicken and stir until well coated. Serve with steamed white rice.

This dish from the rapidly growing Chinese food chain satisfies anyone who loves the famous marinated bourbon chicken found in food courts across America. The sauce is the secret, and it's quick to make right on your own stovetop. Fire up the barbecue for the chicken and cook up a little white rice to serve on the side. Panda Express — now over 700 restaurants strong — is the fastest-growing Asian food chain in the world.

Update: Recently, Panda Express took this item off their menu and replaced it with Grilled Teriyaki Chicken. The only way to enjoy this now Dead Food is to clone it.
