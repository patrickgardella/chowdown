ingredients:
- 1 large egg
- 3 tbsp. red miso paste
- 3/4 tsp. lemon zest plus 2 tbsp. juice (from 1 lemon)
- 1 1/2 lb. ground chicken or turkey (preferably dark meat)
- 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs
- 1 cup thinly sliced scallions
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- 3/4 tsp. grated peeled fresh ginger
- 1 tsp. sugar
- 1 large head Boston or Bibb lettuce, leaves separated
- 3 cups cooked jasmine rice or other long-grain white rice, for serving
- 1 tsp. toasted sesame seeds

directions:
- Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 450Â°. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
- In a large bowl, whisk the egg, 2 tbsp. miso, 2 tsp. sesame oil, the lemon zest, and 1 tsp. salt. Add the chicken, breadcrumbs, and 3/4 cup scallions; using your hands, mix just until combined.
- Dampen your hands and roll the chicken into 24 balls, each about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Arrange the meatballs on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Drizzle the meatballs with the olive oil; gently turn until coated.
- Bake the meatballs for 10 minutes. Turn the meatballs over and continue baking just until cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes more.
- Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the ginger, sugar, the remaining 1 tbsp. miso, 1 tbsp. lemon juice, and 1 tbsp. water for the sauce. In a large bowl, toss the lettuce with the remaining 1 tbsp. lemon juice and 1 tsp. sesame oil. Season the salad with salt.
- Divide the rice, meatballs, and salad among plates. Top with the sauce, the remaining 1/4 cup scallions, and the sesame seeds.
