recipeYield: 10 to 12

ingredients:
- olive oil
- 1 1/2 medium sweet onions (3 cups)
- 1 medium green peppers (1 cup)
- 5 hearts celery ( I estimated 4 whole stalks, but only had hearts) (2 cups)
- 4 - 5 medium carrots ( 3 large would be enough) (1 cup)
- 4 medium sized potatoes (2 lbs)
- 5 - 6 garlic cloves
- 2 quarts chicken stock
- 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 1 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
- 1/2 cup of chopped parsley
- white pepper - 1 tablespoons
- black pepper -1 tablespoons
- salt ( 2 teaspoon, and then salted to taste at end)
- 1 lbs ditalini, as needed when serving ( or stubby pasta of choice)

directions:
- In a large stockpot, heat olive oil under fairly low to medium heat.
- Sweat onion, celery, green pepper and some salt (to draw off moisture) for perhaps 30 minutes. This is lower than browning, and makes the veggies somewhat translucent. I covered, and mixed every few minutes to prevent browning.
- Add carrots, garlic, some white pepper and some black pepper, and continue to heat under "sweat" conditions while mixing now and then.
- Add chicken stock, chicken breasts, tomatoes and potatoes, and of course some more white pepper and black pepper.
- Cover and simmer on low heat for 1.5 to 2 hours (or use crock pot?).
- Remove chicken and let cool and stand to shred.
- Add chopped parsley and return the shredded chicken to the soup.
- Salt to taste at this point, and add more white and black pepper if your tongue is not twitching a bit when you sample. 
- Simmer while cooking ditalini (or other stubby pasta).
- Serve soup over cooked pasta to taste.

Note: Like many soups, this may be better made the day before and then served when needed.
